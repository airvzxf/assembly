# Programming from the ground up

I re-edited the book and all the scrips are in this repository:
[airvzxf/programming-ground-up-and-under-hood](https://github.com/airvzxf/programming-ground-up-and-under-hood).
The source files and the maker script are under the
[resource directory](https://github.com/airvzxf/programming-ground-up-and-under-hood/tree/main/src/programming-from-the-ground-up/resource/asm).
